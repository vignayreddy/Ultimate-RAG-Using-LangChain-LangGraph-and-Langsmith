This means that they learn to predict the next word in a sequence of text, given the context of the previous words.\\n\\nLLMs have many applications, including:\\n\\n1. Text generation: LLMs can generate coherent and natural-sounding text, similar to human writing.\\n2. Language translation: LLMs can translate text from one language to another.\\n3. Sentiment analysis: LLMs can analyze text to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind it.\\n4. Question answering: LLMs can answer questions based on the text they have been trained on.\\n5. Chatbots: LLMs can power chatbots and virtual assistants, enabling them to understand and respond to user input.\\n\\nSome examples of LLMs include:\\n\\n1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\\n2. RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach)\\n3. Transformer-XL\\n4. Longformer\\n5.

Bias and fairness: LLMs can perpetuate biases and stereotypes present in the training data.\\n2. Interpretability: LLMs can be difficult to interpret and understand, making it challenging to identify errors or biases.\\n3. Data quality: LLMs require high-quality training data to perform well, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.\\n\\nOverall, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with language and have many exciting applications in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and human-computer interaction.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 471, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 511, 'completion_time': 1.829077409, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.001730216, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.048278544, 'total_time': 1.830807625}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_68f543a7cc', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c52a0-0a99-7d40-9610-16eac9ab3cb5-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 471, 'total_tokens': 511})"

      "1. Interaction with an environment: This is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning, as the learning process occurs through direct interaction with the environment.\n",

      "3. Penalties: Conversely, penalties are used to discourage undesired behaviors or actions.\n",

    "Follow-up questions that reference previous answers\n",
    "Pronoun resolution (e.g., \"it\", \"they\", \"that\")\n",
